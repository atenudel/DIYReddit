# DIYReddit
This is kind of like a reddit clone for CISC472.

Project 2: DIY Reddit
Due Nov. 18th:

Create a website where users can login/register with OAuth or Password. A user can create topics/channels/subs and add comments to those channels. The comments should be votable up and down. Likewise users can comment on comments and vote those up and down too.

EXTRA CREDIT: If you also implement a moderator role, where a moderator can edit/delete comments or topics.
